                        		Hey there, I'm Justin. I'm currently a third-year Computer Engineering major at Georgia Tech with a primary focus in Software/Web Development and Embedded Systems. I have experience working in both procedural OOP languages and functional low-level languages, not to mention full-stack development experience including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the frontend and SQL in the backend. I'm a dedicated and flexible worker who thrives in group settings and constantly looks forward to being challenged.

                                I'm extremely passionate when it comes to doing what I love to give back and put smiles on faces. Growing up like most people, I was simply a normal kid who had interests. However, my interests didn't start out as interests. Picking up a basketball in 4th grade felt weird because no one on the court around me looked the same. Piano lessons were initially forced into my weeks by my parents. Digital content creation was always intruiging, but felt intimidating in the beginning. However, my interests quickly escalated when I realized they could potentially serve as a personal outlet. I felt a deeper connection with these hobbies as I started expressing myself through unique ways I didn't think were possible. In no time, these activities quickly became engrained into my lifestyle, opened several doors for interacting with different communities, and most importantly helped me find my identity as a person. Read into my experiences to see how my words have manifested into actions.

                        <div class = "sudo">
                        		I spent last summer interning at NASA advancing the inner magnetosphere research area of ional spectral structures and I am currently interning at Lockheed Martin developing software in various areas to meet Navy ship service requirements. I aim to continue using all I have learned in the engineering discipline to make a difference in the world. Read into my projects to see how I've applied my knowledge academically.

                            - The ultimate objective of the game is to find the blue master's loot after a series of interactions with certain NPCs and picking up several important objects. <br />
                            - The game was programmed based on hashtable functions along with other relevant data structures, and the breadboard was manually constructed with an Mbed device, accelerometer, LED screen, speaker, buttons, and was wired utilizing ground voltage and examining pin diagrams.

                            - In my sophomore fall semester, I joined an academic research team (Vertically Integrated Projects) where we focused on the benefits of a crowd-sourced system for various innovative uses similar to big companies. <br />
                            - We created an interactive web application that allows users to mark and describe places on Georgia Tech's campus where disabled students and faculty have a hard time getting around. <br />
                            - I was involved with designing the front end using basic JavaScript/HTML/CSS, extracting data using Google Firebase, and sorting data using the k-means algorithm in a Python script to cluster most frequent responses.

                        <p>
                            - In high school, a peer and I created a full interactive two-player Yahtzee game using a Java GUI, an applet class, and numerous manually created functions accounting for mouse-game interaction, dice rolls, continuous score updates, and overall game functionality + design.
